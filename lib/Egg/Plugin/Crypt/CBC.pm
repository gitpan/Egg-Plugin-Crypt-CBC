=head1 NAME

Egg::Plugin::Crypt::CBC - Crypt::CBC for Egg Plugin.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Egg qw/ Crypt::CBC /;
  
  __PACKAGE__->egg_startup(
   .....
   ...
  
   plugin_crypt_cbc => {
     cipher=> 'Blowfish',
     key   => 'uniqueid',
     ...
     },
  
   );

  # The text is encrypted.
  my $crypt= $e->cbc->encode($text);
  
  # The code end text is decrypted.
  my $plain= $e->cbc->decode($crypt);
  
  # The cbc object is acquired in an arbitrary option.
  my $cbc= $e->cbc( cipher => 'DES' );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It is a plugin to use the code and decoding by L<Crypt::CBC>.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

HASH is defined in 'plugin_crypt_cbc' key and it sets it.

The setting is an option to pass everything to L<Crypt::CBC>.

Please refer to the document of L<Crypt::CBC> for details.

=head2 cipher

The exception is generated in case of undefined.

=head2 key

The exception is generated in case of undefined.

=head2 iv

'$KJh#(}q' is provisionally defined in case of undefined.

Please define it.

=head2 padding

Default is 'standard'.

=head2 prepend_iv

Default is 0.

=head2 regenerate_key

Default is 1.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 cbc ( [OPTION_HASH] )

The handler object of this plugin is returned.

It turns by using the same object when the object is generated once usually.
When OPTION_HASH is given, it tries to generate the object newly.

=head1 HANDLER METHODS

The handler object has succeeded to L<Crypt::CBC>.

=head1 new

Constructor.

=head1 encode ( [PLAIN_TEXT] )

After PLAIN_TEXT is encrypted, the Base64 encode text is returned.

  my $crypt_text= $e->cbc->encode( 'plain text' );

=head1 decode ( [CRYPT_TEXT] )

The text encrypted by 'encode' method is made to the compound and returned.

  my $plain_text= $e->cbc->decode( 'crypt text' );
